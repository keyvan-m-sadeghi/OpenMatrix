## Summary
[summary]: #summary

[Data is the new oil][1]. Businesses and people are paying dearly for obtaining
accurate data in their domains of work. Yet, the data is mostly available over
the internet free of charge. The problem is, the free data is mostly only
"current", meaning one can only see the current value, not the history. E.g.
stocks data is available on many websites, though one would be asked to pay to
get the history for the past five years. OpenMatrix aims to bridge this gap.
It is a platform for firing up crawlers that access resources over the
internet, read current values and store them. This process is repeated over
defined intervals or triggers. Data cleansing can happen in-place. Hence, the
user would have access to clean, accurate data in time.
